# Sorting-algorithms
Task 1 Competitive programming
M.Nisith 23BDS0059
This program contains implements Bubble, Insertion and Selection sort.

It accepts array size and elements from the user and sorts it using the 3 different functions and displays them individually

Bubble sort: Time complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (when the input array is already sorted)
Insertion Sort: Time complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, O(n) in the best case (when the input array is already sorted)
Selection Sort: Time complexity: O(n^2) in all cases (worst, average, and best)

In terms of perfomance, insertion sort tends to perform better than bubble or selection
